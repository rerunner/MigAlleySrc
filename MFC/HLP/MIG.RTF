You are supporting a ground battle that is being fought on the Korean peninsula. As the peninsula runs north-south you will find that the front line generally lies east-west. Although your specific objectives will vary from campaign to campaign, the overa
ll objective is to support the UN ground forces in their effort to move the front line up to the Chinese border.
\par It is possible to support the ground forces by flying Close Air Support missions. This may be necessary when UN Forces are in danger of being ov
er-run. However this is not necessarily the best use of your resources. The Communist ground threat depends on getting supplies to the front line. Successful Interdiction missions can therefore delay a Communist advance and even force a retreat.
\par For the sake of convenience, three Main Supply Routes (MSR) have been identified. There is one on the West Coast, one in the Central Region and one on the East. Each Communist asset has been allocated to a route so that during briefings you will be able t
o determine its sphere of influence. Often the sphere of influence is obvious; sometimes though, because of the mountainous landscape, the connection is not immediately apparent. 
\par It should be noted that the Supply Routes do not operate independently. There are many cross-links that the Communists use to bypass destroyed bridges etc.

\par \pard\plain \sa120\nowidctlpar \f5\fs22 Your have five fighter squadrons and two bomber squadrons under your command. 
\par The fighter squadrons which are based in Korea, consist of:
\par \pard\plain \s49\li720\sa120\nowidctlpar \f5\fs22 Two squadrons of F86 Sabre Jet aircraft. These are the best air combat aircraft at your disposal. Sabres are only armed for air to air duties.
\par \pard\plain \li720\sa120\nowidctlpar \f5\fs22 One squadron of F84E jets and one squadron of F80C jets. These aircraft are best suited to ground strike duties. The MiG15 in combat outclasses them.
\par One squadron of F51 prop aircraft. These aircraft are no match for the MiG15 in combat. However they are useful for Close Air Support and Interdiction Missions close to the front.
\par \pard \sa120\nowidctlpar The bomber squa
drons are based in Japan. On any particular day you will have either a squadron of B29 heavy bombers or B26 medium bomber aircraft available. B29s are preferable because they deliver a bigger punch. However if the attrition rate becomes too high they will
 be withheld.
\par Each squadron of pilots is organized into six flights of four. However, the maximum number of aircraft that can be launched at any session is sixteen and therefore only four flights can fly. This gives you the option of resting pilots. 
\par Aircra
ft are allocated in units of four, i.e. in flights. So, for instance, if you have designed four Strike Missions it would be possible to allocate two flights of Sabres to each mission. Alternatively you could allocate one flight to each mission and the rem
aining four Sabre flights could be allocated together to form a MiGCAP over MiG Alley. 
\par A flight consists of two elements of two aircraft. The leader/wingman element is the smallest fighting unit in MiG Alley. Although aircraft are allocated to missions in flights, it is possible to allocate duties to individual elements.

 HIDD_MISSIONGENERATION}}Missions Generation
\par \pard\plain \sa120\nowidctlpar \f5\fs22 Missions can be generated in a number of ways:
\par \pard \li720\sa120\nowidctlpar By initiating Directives, the Mission Folder will be filled automatically.
\par Clicking on authorize on either the Target Dialogue or Dossier will produce the framework for a mission.
\par \pard\plain \s49\li720\sa120\nowidctlpar \f5\fs22 On the Mission Results Dialogue click on {\uldb redo}{\v HIDD_RESULTS} to carry the highlighted mission over to the next day.
\par \pard \s49\sa120\nowidctlpar If a mission is marked for {\i Redo, }then the aircraft required are automatically removed from the available set before the Directives automatically build the next session\rquote s missions.

\par \pard\plain \sa120\nowidctlpar \f5\fs22 Up to 10 completely independent missions can be set up for any particular session. 
\par Each mission can consist of up to six Waves. A Wave is made up of the Strike or Main Duty Group that can be supported by an Air Cover Group and an AAA Group. Each Wave can have its own ToT (Time over Target).
\par This system gives the flexibility to design either many small missions or fewer complex missions. 
\par Templates or {\uldb profiles}{\v HIDD_LOADPROFILE} can be produced so that you can easily regenerate missions.
\par The Mission Structure has been designed to allow you to generate missions that were typical during the conflict. For instance, due to limited fuel capacity, Combat Air Patrol aircraft could only stay on station for about twenty minutes. MiG pilots soon re
alized this and so they waited until the Sabres started to leave before mounting an attack. In this situation the Sabres were vulnerable because they did not have the fuel to stay and fight and also
 get home. To combat this tactic Sabres were organized into Waves so that as one Wave was ready to leave another was arriving.

\par \pard\plain \s49\sa120\nowidctlpar \f5\fs22  A route is a set of waypoints. Initially, each route consists of the same standard set of waypoints:
\par \pard \s49\li720\sa120\nowidctlpar {\b Take-Off
\par Rendezvous}
\par Flights from different airfields will join up here
\par {\b Ingress

\par {\b Disperse
\par }Flights from different airfields split up
\par {\b Landing
\par }\pard \s49\sa120\nowidctlpar {\b 
\par }As it is possible to drag waypoints around the map, Ingress and Egress waypoints are not always strictly associated with the position of enemy airspace.
\par Aircraft in the same Wave fly together from the Rendezvous to the Initial Point. Each Group then has its own set of waypoints to follow in the Target Zone.
\par It is possible to insert and delete additional waypoints. However it is not possible to delete any of the standard set. Additional waypoints can be added to both the main route and Target Zone.
\par Waypoints can be set for individual elements. If you had a mission with two flights of Flak Suppression aircraft, you could give the four elements different routes in the Target Zone. As it is possible to define Main and Secondary Targets, you could autho
rize eight different targets with just two flights of aircraft.

\par {\b Available Aircraft
\par }The number of available aircraft for the squadron is displayed at the bottom of the dialogue.
\par At the start of a campaign, each squadron will have 19 aircraft available. That means you start with 3 spare aircraft for each squadron. Repair and replacement of aircraft takes time. It is possible

\par \pard\plain \sa120\nowidctlpar \f5\fs22 In the game the user nose art exists in two forms: one for the map screen and one for the 3D section. Changing the nose art is therefore a two-stage process:
\par \pard \li720\sa120\nowidctlpar Modify the mapscreen nose art in a standard art pack.
\par \pard\plain \s49\li720\sa120\nowidctlpar \f5\fs22 Run a conversion program, which we have provided, to produce the form of the nose art for the 3D section of the game.
\par \pard \s49\sa120\nowidctlpar {\b Modifying the Mapscreen Nose Art
\par }The source files will be found in: \\{\f3 artwork\\noseuser. }If you haven\rquote t changed the default directory the full path will be: {\f3 \\rowan\\mig\\artwork\\noseuser\\.
\par }\pard\plain \s52\qj\sa120\nowidctlpar \f5\fs22 The nose art consists of sixteen files in the bmp file format. You can edit any or all of these files in your art pack. The following restrictions apply:
\par \pard\plain \li720\sa120\nowidctlpar \f5\fs22 Each piece of artwork must be 64 pixels x 64 pixels and must have 256 Colors.
\par The palette cannot be changed.
\par Color 253 must not be used.
\par Color 254 is the mask color \endash  this will be transparent and not show up on the aircraft.
\par Color 255 should be pure white (255,255,255).
\par \pard \sa120\nowidctlpar After saving out a modified piece of nose art, it will be possible to view the change on the mapscreen paint shop dialogue. At this stage, though, the change will not be available in the 3D.
\par {\b Preparing the Artwork for the 3D Game
\par }To make the modified artwork available in the 3D part of the game, you need to run the \lquote nose art\rquote  program that is installed in the same directory as MiG Alley.
\par There are two other ways of running the nose art program:
\par \pard \li720\sa120\nowidctlpar It is available as a menu item in the MiG Alley section of the Start Menus.
\par It can be initiated from the command line with the command:  {\f3 tt2 \endash r user.res
\par }\pard \sa120\nowidctlpar {\b 
\par }Running the nose art program will produce a new version of the file: {\f3 MaskMap\\UsrDecal.X8
\par }If at any time any of the user nose art files are corrupted then they can be replaced by copying from the original CD. The directory names on the CD are identical to those on the installed version.

\par }}{\b\fs32 Weather}
\par This Dialogue shows the weather forecast for North Korea for the next session.
\par {\b Conditions/Visibility
\par }This information should be considered when making target choices. Your aircraft are not fitted with sophisticated radar equipment and so target acquisition is by eye. In bad conditions, choose targets that will be easily identified.
\par {\b Temperature and Pressure
\par }During the summer, it may be difficult for some aircraft with heavy payloads to get into the air.
\par {\b Contrail Layer
\par }The contrail layer should determine at which altitude you fly. The MiGs have the advantage of being able to fly higher and so generally you should instruct flights to fly below the
 contrail layer. An attacking MiG is easier to spot as it descends through the layer.
\par {\b Wind Speed and Direction
\par }Wind speed and direction are quoted at two different altitudes. At certain times of the year it is more likely that the jet stream will offer a tail wind on egress. You should take advantage of this bonus.
\par {\b Gusts
\par }If the weather is changeable, it is likely that you will suffer from gusts. This will make flying more stressful as you have to constantly adjust the controls.
\par {\b Special Notes
\par }This gives the forecaster the opportunity of telling you about any special weather effects to note. For instance there may be mist in the valleys.

\par \pard\plain \sa120\nowidctlpar \f5\fs22 This Dialogue displays the controls for the automatic mission builder. When setting up the mission builder, you have to make two major decisions:
\par \pard \li720\sa120\nowidctlpar The priority that you want to give to each Mission Type.
\par The maximum resource to allocate to each Mission Type.
\par \pard\plain \s3\sb240\sa60\nowidctlpar \b\f5\fs28 Cross Boxes
\par \pard\plain \sa120\nowidctlpar \f5\fs22 There are three cross-boxes at the top of the Dialogue:
\par \pard \li720\sa120\nowidctlpar {\b Autodisplay
\par }Automatically displays the Dialogue at the beginning of each session.
\par {\b Autogenerate
\par }\pard\plain \s49\li720\sa120\nowidctlpar \f5\fs22 Automatically generates missions at the beginning of each session. If this option is selected, the missions will be generated even if the Dialogue is not displayed.
\par \pard\plain \li720\sa120\nowidctlpar \f5\fs22 {\b Alpha Strikes
\par }If this option is selected, all aircraft are allocated against one target.
\par \pard\plain \s3\sb240\sa60\nowidctlpar \b\f5\fs28 Priority List
\par \pard\plain \sa120\nowidctlpar \f5\fs22 The list below the cross-boxes consists of a set of Mission Types. At the top and bottom of the list there are two special cases:
\par \pard \li720\sa120\nowidctlpar At the top there is a record of the aircraft already in use. If you have decided to {\uldb redo}{\v HIDD_RESULTS} any missions that were unsuccessful on previous sessions, then this line will show the aircraft needed.
\par The bottom line shows the aircraft that you are not planning to use for this session.
\par \pard \sa120\nowidctlpar Here is a typical entry for a standard Mission Type:
\par Category\tab Strike\tab \tab Fighters\tab Targets\tab Missions
\par Airfields\tab 48\tab \tab 16\tab \tab 19\tab \tab 4
\par This line shows that when 48 Strike and 16 Fighter aircraft are allocated against Airfields, the automatic mission builder found 19 possible targets and was able to use the aircraft allocation to set up 4 missions.
\par The number and type of aircraft and duties allocated by the automatic mission builder will reflect the status of the target. For instance, sometimes only medium bombers will be appropriate together with Air and AAA Cover, other times a single flight of F5
1s may be suitable. 
\par For the sake of the Directives, the two Sabre squadrons are considered to be Fighter aircraft and the rest are put in the Strike Category. You therefore have up to 32 Fighters and 64 Strike aircraft available. 
\par \pard\plain \s3\sb240\sa60\nowidctlpar \b\f5\fs28 Functions
\par \pard\plain \sa120\nowidctlpar \f5\fs22 
The Strike and Fighter aircraft combo-boxes can be used to alter the allocations of aircraft. The list is in order of priority with the Mission Types at the top having the top priority. You will find that it is not possible to allocate more than the maxim
um available aircraft. Whenever you make a change the allocations are rechecked. If you request more aircraft than are available then the Mission Types at the top of the list are given the priority.
\par To change the order of priorities, click on a Mission Type and then drag the mouse pointer to the desired new position. On releasing the mouse button, the Mission Type will be placed in the new position.
\par Click on a Mission Type to view details about the targets found and missions found. This information can be used to fine-tune the Directives request to maximize the missions launched.

\par You can use this Dialogue to define the main duty of the Wave and the Time over Target (ToT). It is possible to define a Time over Target that would result in the Wave arriving before the main Wave. Th
is could be useful, for instance, if you want to do some flak suppression before your main Wave arrives.
\par There are three possible types of main duty that can be allocated to a Wave:
\par {\b Bomb 
\par }A mission can consist of a number of Strike Waves. Each Wave can be allocated the main target for the mission or secondary targets can be introduced. 
\par A Crack and Burn mission would consist of two Waves. These missions are useful against substantial warehouses that contain flammable stores. The first Wave would use iron bo
mbs to crack open the store. The second Wave would use napalm to destroy the stores.
\par {\b Flak Suppression
\par }\pard\plain \s52\sa120\nowidctlpar \f5\fs22 When an important target is heavily defended, it is reasonable to send out a Wave that arrives before the main strike force to suppress the flak.

\par }\pard\plain \s52\sa120\nowidctlpar \f5\fs22 
When an important target is located within the MiG area of influence, it is reasonable to send out a Wave that arrives before the main strike force to set up a Combat Air Patrol which acts as a barrier between the strike force and the MiGs.
\par \pard\plain \sa120\nowidctlpar \f5\fs22

\par It is possible to change the squadron allocated to the Current Group by clicking on the appropriate line in the list. However, it will not be possible to highlight a line for which there are no flights available.

\par \pard\plain \sa120\nowidctlpar \f5\fs22 See {\uldb Routes Overview}{\v HIDD_ROUTESINTRO} for a description about routes and waypoints in MiG Alley.
\par Information about the Route for the Current Wave is organized onto two tabs:
\par \pard \li720\sa120\nowidctlpar Main Route
\par Target Zone
\par \pard \sa120\nowidctlpar For each tab it is possible to view the waypoint information in either Summary or Detail Form.
\par \pard\plain \s3\sb240\sa60\nowidctlpar \b\f5\fs28 Main Route: Summary Mode
\par \pard\plain \sa120\nowidctlpar \f5\fs22 In Summary Mode, a list of all the waypoints on the main route is displayed together with one attribute. Information about the following attributes are obtained by making a selection from the combo-box:
\par \pard \li720\sa120\nowidctlpar Position
\par Altitude
\par ETA
\par ETA (rel)
\par Main Duty Fuel
\par AAA Cover Fuel
\par Air Cover Fuel
\par \pard \sa120\nowidctlpar 
The altitude can be displayed in either feet or meters and the fuel is displayed in either pounds or kilograms. The choice of units can be changed on the Units options on the View set of Preferences. The altitude shown is for the lead group. Escort 
groups that are of the same aircraft type as the lead group will also fly at this altitude. Other escort groups will fly at 1000ft below the contrail layer.
\par The ETA is the estimated time of arrival at the waypoint. It is assumed that the Wave will travel at the cruise velocity of the slowest aircraft. The ETA (rel) is the ETA relative to the {\uldb initial point}{\v HIDD_ROUTESINTRO}.
\par The Fuel figures show the estimated fuel remaining at the waypoint. 
\par 
\par When Route information is being displayed in Summary Form, there are three buttons at the bottom of the Dialogue:
\par {\b Insert
\par }Insert a waypoint after the currently highlighted waypoint. The highlight moves to the inserted waypoint. 
\par {\b Delete
\par }Delete the currently highlighted waypoint. You can only delete waypoints that you have inserted.
\par {\b Center
\par }Scroll the map so that the highlighted waypoint is at the center.
\par \pard\plain \s3\sb240\sa60\nowidctlpar \b\f5\fs28 Main Route: Detail
\par \pard\plain \sa120\nowidctlpar \f5\fs22 In Detail Mode, all the attributes for the highlighted waypoint are displayed. In this mode it is possible to change the altitude and ETA for some waypoints:
\par {\b Altitude
\par }All but the take-off and landing waypoints can be edited.
\par {\b ETA
\par }Only the ETA of the Initial Point can be edited.
\par 
\par For Detail Mode, there are two more buttons at the bottom of the Dialogue. These allow you to move to the next or previous waypoint in the route. In addition, clicking on the box containing the waypoint description will center the map onto the waypoint.

\par \pard\plain \s3\sb240\sa60\nowidctlpar \b\f5\fs28 Target Zone: Summary
\par \pard\plain \sa120\nowidctlpar \f5\fs22 The layout is similar to the one for{\i  Main Route: Summary. 
\par }On the Main Route, the Groups fly in formation. When they reach the Target Zone, they split off and follow their own set of waypoints. There is a tab for each Group so that each set is viewed separately. 
\par The list of Target Zone waypoints always starts with the Initial Point and ends with the Regroup waypoint.
\par Compared with the Main Route Dialogue, there is an extra combo-box for the Target Zone. The options are:
\par \pard \li720\sa120\nowidctlpar Group
\par Flight
\par Element
\par \pard \sa120\nowidctlpar You can use this combo-box to view and edit the waypoints at any of the above levels. It is possible then to give orders either at the Group, Flight or Element Level. 
\par For instance, if you want to send out a Group on Flak Suppression, you could just send the Group to patrol an area and let the pilots pick their own targets. However if you know where the targets are and you want to be sure that they are attacked then you
 can allocate up to two targets to each element.
\par 
\par Instructions on setting extra targets are given in the {\uldb Task Dialogue.}{\v HIDD_TASKTABS}
\par \pard\plain \s3\sb240\sa60\nowidctlpar \b\f5\fs28 Target Zone: Detail
\par \pard\plain \sa120\nowidctlpar \f5\fs22 The layout is identical to the one for the Main Route.

\par \pard\plain \sa120\nowidctlpar \f5\fs22 This dialogue gives further information about the mission and target highlighted on the Mission Results Dialogue. The form of the dialogue will depend on the type of mission.
\par 
\par To get further information about kills and losses, you should go to the {\uldb Squadron dialogue}{\v HIDD_SQUADS}. Clicking on the Losses button will list the pilots in your command that h
ave been killed. Clicking on any of the pilots on the Squadron dialogue will open the pilot details for that pilot\rquote s flight. The kills on the last mission are displayed as well as the total kills.
